# Clickable Links Plus

## Description

Plugin for Omeka Classic. Once installed and active, URLs contained in selected elements will be turned into hyperlinks opening up in a new page (target = "_blank"). Plugin works with all valid web URLs and e-mail addresses.

The plugin uses the free js library Linkify for finding links in plain-text and converting them to HTML <a> tags.

Settings allow to choose the elements affected by the plugin, plus whether to show a tooltip, whether to shorten the visibile URL and whether to affect only well-formatted URLs.

## Installation
Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "EmailNotification".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin.

## Warning
Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
